# Modify SWA calendar files
This file-action triggered workflow modifies Southwest Airlines calendar (ICS) files to fit my needs. 


The default ICS files contains all the crucial information but it's not that well arranged for viewing on mobile devices and there's a lot of extraneous text in the notes. I wanted to rearrange and streamline the information to make the event title show just the flight numbers (e.g., SWA: 5956/5694), have the location be the start and end airport codes (e.g., ABQ to SLC), include one day and 2 hour alerts and edit the notes field to contain only the trip itinerary.
